### R1D1 - 1/14/2019

    I am working on Project 5 of Paul Hudson's (@twostraws) Hacking with Swift. It is a word scramble game. 
    
    The main topics of this lesson are:
    - UIAlertController
    - promptForAnswer()
    - regular closures & trailing closures
    
    I got to a stopping point after about 2 hours worth of learning and work. I was able to run the app and play around with the basic concept of adding works to the table that could be made up of the given word.
